## ToDo list

- [x] Populate the Stables
- [x] Expand the story
- [ ] Finish the story
- [x] ~~Test Nvidia GPU support~~ Fix the bug (Nvidia windowed, weird rendering)
- [x] Fix the shapeshift issue when out of map

## Testing

- [x] Keyboard/mouse controls
- [x] Controller
- [x] Memory leaks -> It seems alright, but is very hard to monitor the RAM usage when using the GPU...
